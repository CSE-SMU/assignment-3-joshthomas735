# Assignment 2 Postmortem

## What's your name?
    Josh Thomas 


## How difficult was this assignment?
    Moderatley Difficult. Not too bad because Bootstrap has really great documentation. I was able to look at the element you created on the screenshot, and match it to one of the components that bootstrap creates standard. Then I just copied the bootstrap code and tweaked it as necessary. 


## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?
    I got a much better understanding of what boostrap can do and how to use it by doing this assigment. Having to figure out for ourselves how to change the default boostrap content to match screenshot/sketch gave me a really in-depth understanding of how to manipulate and use boostrap. 


## How could this assignment be improved?
    I was a bit lost at first when trying to jump straight into learning to use SASS, so perhaps a bit more description of how to use SASS to manipulate boostrap would be helpful. 


## Any other comments?
    Nope.
